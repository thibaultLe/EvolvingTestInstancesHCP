# EvolvingTestInstancesHCP

These are all the test instances used in the paper 'Evolving test instances of the Hamiltonian completion problem'

The folders are named after how the instances were added. 

Namely: 'Evo' means we evolved them by maximizing the difference in runtime of the 2 considered solvers. 

'NT' means we evolved away from other instances, thereby maximizing the distance to the nearest other instance.

'T' means we evolved to specific target points where there were gaps in the instance space.
